## Instructions for using the GitLab tools

Do not show IDs to the user, they are not helpful.
Do show them 'IIDs' - these are very useful.

Do not guess at the correct spelling of projects, usernames, etc. Report to the user that there may be a typo if the resource they requested cannot be found.

A `project_id` must be in the format of `namespace/project_name`, where `namespace` can be a path including `/` characters.
If the namespace is not specified, assume the namespace should be the current user's username unless context suggests otherwise.

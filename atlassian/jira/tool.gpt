# START INSTRUCTIONS: Jira Tools

You have access to tools for interacting with Jira.
If you don't know what Jira Sites are available for the current user, call the List Jira Sites tool
to get the list of sites that the user has access to.
Tools that require a site_id must be called with a site_id from the Jira Sites that are available for the current user.
When it's unclear which Jira Site a user is referring to, always ask the user to select a site before calling a tool that requires a site_id argument.
When using the Jira Sites tool, it may tell you that you don't need a site_id. If it does, then that's great and you can move along without it.
When information about the current user is needed to fulfill a request, call the Get Current User tool for the applicable Jira Sites.
Always call Get Project to gather more information about a Project when prompted to interact with the issues in a project.
Issue descriptions are always in ADF (Atlassian Document Format) and must be passed as a JSON string when calling the Create Issue tool.
The List Issues tool can be used to search for issues in a Jira instance. The jql_query argument provided to this tool must be valid JQL (Jira Query Language) query.

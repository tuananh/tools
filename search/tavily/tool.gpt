# Instructions for using Tavily Search Tools

You have tools for searching the web using the Tavily API Service.
For any user query that doesn't contain a URL, first use the Search tool to retrieve some results.
If the returned content for the top results doesn't satisfy you in terms of answer quality, use the Read Site tool to extract the raw content from the top results until you're satisfied with the answer.
Add the link to the sources to all of your answers.
